        <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
        <p>Krishnamurti was a philosopher, speaker, and writer</p>
        <p><strong>Born 11th May 1895 - Died 17th February 1986</strong></p>
        <p>Krishnamurti was “Discovered” at the age 14 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society" target="blank">Theosophical Society</a> (a spiritualist organization founded in New York in 1875). The Theosophists believed that the world was periodically visited by a spiritual teacher (they claimed Buddha and Jesus Christ to be manifestations of this entity), and that the next World Teacher would appear in the 20th Century.
    The Theosophists believed that the young Krishnamurti was the “vehicle” for the next World Teacher.</p>
        <p>They spent the next 10 years training and teaching Krishnamurti in meditation and other spiritual practises. 
    Krishnamurti's journey and insights led him to reject the role that had been prepared for him. At the annual meeting of the Theosophy Society in 1929, in which Krishnamurti was due to become the head of the organization, instead he dissolved the society and said:
    </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti#Break_with_the_past">
          <p>“I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or coerce people along a particular path. ... This is no magnificent deed, because I do not want followers, and I mean this. The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth. I am not concerned whether you pay attention to what I say or not. I want to do a certain thing in the world, and I am going to do it with unwavering concentration. I am concerning myself with only one essential thing: to set man free. I desire to free him from all cages, from all fears, and not to found religions, new sects, nor to establish new theories and new philosophies.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>His interests included psychological revolution, the nature of mind, meditation, holistic inquiry, human relationships, and bringing about radical change in society. He stressed the need for a revolution in the psyche of every human being and emphasised that such revolution cannot be brought about by any external authority, be it religious, political, or social.</p>
