# Tribute Page (HTML, CSS and Git practice)

## This tribute page was completed as part of the pre-course tasks before starting on the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp in April 2022.

This task was a introduction to using Git and VScode to:

  * _clone_ your repository,  _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files and _add, commit and push_ your changes to the new repository.

  *with your own code (from CodePen) 

  * . Pretty cool eh?
